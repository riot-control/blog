Many times I've heard and read things like "try a different road to work" or "wear a different color" today. The purpose is to break routine habits and feed your mind with something different. Ultimately, you're supposed to *feel* different, which is a good thing, right? Yes, it is.

We've acquired the habit of repetition from the industrial revolution. Repetition was a good thing those days. But the world is different now and work is not what it used to be. Although there's some room for repetition, and in many jobs it's actually good, most *modern* jobs need the opposite: creativity.

Not wanting to go into techniques for creativity, there's a small thing that usually works for me: sit in a different seat. Whenever I do this, the way I *feel* the company is different. Which, ultimately, leads to seeing problems in a new perspective. Some days I walk in and go straight to a meeting room alone, some days I sit on the lounge area with the laptop, some days I work remotely. And some days, I choose one of my colleague's seat. (Obvisoully, when they're not here!). It also gives me a better feel of each team's dynamics.

So, this time it was Paulo. He's on holidays. I loved his seat! :)

Some companies have taken this further and have standing work spots and also rooms with different *vibes*. I like this approach. Different people have different needs.
