In Paulo's post about [presenters and views](http://www.riot-control.net/2013/11/27/refactoring-views-with-presenters-ruby-on-rails/),
he talked about how to make the view independent on outside logic. This is
_confidant coding_. The following _talk_ shows this in a wider perspective. Not
only for views/presenters, but for all code.
