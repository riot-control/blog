Imagine that you are on a tango final, dancing with a co-worker. You're in the
_spotlight_ and sudently, your friend misses a step. You now have two options.

<!-- more -->

*Number one:* You think that he ruined it all. It was his fault, he should have done it better.
You may continue to dance, but you feel betrayed. You're in anger and in the next
day you'll make sure all the other co-workers know about this.

*Number two:* Or you may forfeit the final. You know that the final is lost, and all you can do
is continue and try to finish in style. You are sad because you lost the final on
the count of this error. But you focus on holding your co-worker safe, making him
overcome this. You start to think on how to talk to him about this, and focus on
what you can do to never again have this hapenning.

I make a lot of mistakes. Sometimes I may do things that other co-workers condemn.
I do try to make my best, every day. So please, if I let you down, please be
my number two (_no pun intended_).
